# Examples of math graphs with manim

Here are some graphs i do in manim, you can take it as reference for your own use, take in count that for personal preferences i usually use white background in the images instead of black which is by default for the library.

The `environment.yml` file contains all the dependencies needed for run this repository, you will need to use [Conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda) and run: `conda env create -n ENVNAME --file environment.yml`.

The `execution.sh` file is for run all the python scripts(its for Linux), or yo can simply run `python file_you_want.py` and search in the media folder for the corresponding output.

Now here you have a pile of examples of manim and their corresponding python scripts in this repository.
